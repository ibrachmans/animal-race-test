# Animal Race

This page is part of an interview test.

The initial goal was to make a SPA that could list preexisting animals and register new ones.

Since it's a frontend challenge, the test is supposed to run without a backend, so you can use BDD with CYPRESS
to create a backend mockup.

## Installation

You can use any IDE of your preference and i'm using only vanilla javascript.
